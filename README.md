# **Mapping_Earthquakes**

--------------------------------

- This week we learned about GeoJSON data and how it can be used to help quickly and effectively create maps to represent the data you need.  Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

- First we went out and got the boundaries of the tetonic plates and added them as a layer to our map that can be tooggled with a button 
- Then we wented to narrow our visualiztion with and look more specifically in to the earthquakes that made a magnitude of < 4.5.
- Then we had to add a third map style, we choose:  
      1.  Streets 
      2.  Satellite 
      3.  Dark 

# **Summary**

--------------------------------

Leaflet is a very powerful map generating tool that can create limitless possibilities for visualizations.  This knowledge can be tranlated into many app and industries.  For me personally I saw this and immediately thought of the little screens on the backs of the seats in the planes that show you where your are and tracking your flight.
